# SimpliServers Operating System Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to keep our clients informed about workflow, releases, planned features and decommissions of our VPS templates and ISOs.

## How to use
- The backlog contains information about the currently scheduled features.
- You may **monitor a certain feature** to receive email alerts when it changes or advances.
- You can **comment or vote** on the features that are presented to affect our priorities and requirements.
- By sending a support request, you can **add a new issue** to the queue of considerations.

## Workflow
- Every 14 days, new requests are assessed to see if they fit with our strategic intent. If they do, they are added to the board.
- We frequently make commitments to brand-new backlog items. If the item is in Backlog, it means that the suggestions were accepted, however, there is currently no active progress on it apart from essential planning.
- These components are updated to "**Coming soon**" status as they get closer to the planned production date. The feature may be anticipated to be published within about **2-4 months**. 
- The OS will transition to the "Approaching EOS (6 months)" stage once the formal End of Support date which is described in the card is approaching. The clients will also get an email update regarding the changes and additional revelations.
- After the official installation support has ended, we will transfer it to "End of support," where it will be archived after six months.

## Proposing a new feature
- Focus mainly on new features (aka functional enhancements, new localizations, UX improvements). Specific problem reports should be reported to customer service.
- Send a support ticket to customer support if you think you've discovered a security flaw.
- To prevent duplication, please check "Existing issues" before submitting your suggestion.
- Please provide a brief description of the feature, preferably in the form of an agile user narrative.
